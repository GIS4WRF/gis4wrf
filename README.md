# GIS4WRF
GIS4WRF is a free and open source [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) plug-in to help researchers and practitioners with their [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) modelling workflows. GIS4WRF can be used to pre-process input data, run simulations, and visualize or post-process results on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu — if you would like us to support other Linux distributions, fix a bug you have found, or simply add a new feature, do let us know by [opening an issue](issues).
