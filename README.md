# GIS4WRF
GIS4WRF is a free and open source [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) plug-in to help researchers and practitioners with their [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) modelling workflows. GIS4WRF can be used to pre-process input data, run simulations, and visualize or post-process results. We offer MPI-enabled pre-built binary distributions for Windows, macOS and Linux through [WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/WRF).

**For information on how to install GIS4WRF, or check out the main documentation and tutorials, please refer to the GIS4WRF website at https://gis4wrf.github.io.**
